1. Sorting items list by ordering when multiple categories has performance issues since we have to order by two columns of two different tables.
We can disable sorting by ordering when multiple categories are selected. After all ordering is only available in the same category.
Alternatively we can make the ordering global and not relate it with categories.

2. Tag cloud (mod_k2_tools) has performance issues since we need to check the items category and the item access/publish status. 
We could avoid the access/publish checks but we need to check the category. 

3. Archive (mod_k2_tools) has performance issue since we need to compute the month (MONTH() SQL) for every item in order to get the last 12 months that there are items. 
Probably we need to change the way the archive works to be like "x" months back from now.

4. Authors list (mod_k2_tools) has performance issue since we need to also filter by category, item state/access etc.

5. Latest comments (mod_k2_comments) also has small performance issue since we need to also filter by category, item state/access etc.

6. Users with most popular items and most commented items need a lot of time. Both of them are using temporary table.

7. We can improve the advanced SEF options and make them much more. We need to replace the prefix with a menu link selection. 
This way we will get rid of 'component/k2' in URLs and we will get rid of the duplicate URLs issue. 
Actually this will do what the generic K2 link to all categories does for v2 but it will be specific to each content type.

8. "Change root attachments folder" is not implemented yet. We need to see how this will work since we can have attachments stored at the cloud.

9. Revisions interface is not implemented. However the server side code exists.

10. "Front-end editing options" are not implemented (the swicthes for hiding/showing the tabs) .
